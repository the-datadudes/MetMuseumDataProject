# MetMuseumDataProject

The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York is one of the world’s largest and finest art museums.

In this project, I am working with a table named met that contains the museum’s collection of American Decorative Arts.

It has the following columns:

    id - the id of the art piece
    department - the department of the art piece
    category - the category of the art piece
    title - the title name of the art piece
    artist - the name of the artist
    date - the date(s) of the art piece
    medium - the medium of the art piece
    country - the country of the artist

This data was kindly made publicly available under their Open Access Policy, which can be viewed directly at:
